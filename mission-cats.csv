"Getting new members it's essential for us to break even on rent +debt. We should have some sort of consensus (or near consensus) voting scheme for new members, which should include an interview by a committee of members. We should have flexible membership options, some of which don't involve renting specific space (ie a container) but just using the public space. Talking to David korman right now, he said he'd be down to pay $100 per month to be able to use the space to work on projects. He is also super interesting in doing new member interviews, which I highly recommend him for.

I think we should strike a balance between a community resource and a free-for-all of random people visiting all the time/just walking on in and borrowing things, where the makers are at the epicenter of a constant stream of people. I also think we should have a calendar of events that is very clear what is happening when and other times when the farm is not open to the public.",,Community Resource,"providing material resouces,studio and workshop space for members",
