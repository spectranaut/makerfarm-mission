Diversity of makers - would like to reach out to include more POC.,Diversity of Membership,
Co-op (1 member 1 vote) structure!,Co-op structure,
all members teaching at least 1 hands-on workshop to local (APC-housed) community members a year!,Membership Expectations,
"Gain new members through time spent on the farm (open to all - come by and hang out and DO stuff, once they spent some # of hours on the farm (20? 40?), invite them to a meeting to join.  members DONT need to have storage on site - members should be allowed to be members without paying for space)!",Membership Expectations,
"Getting new members it's essential for us to break even on rent +debt. We should have some sort of consensus (or near consensus) voting scheme for new members, which should include an interview by a committee of members. We should have flexible membership options, some of which don't involve renting specific space (ie a container) but just using the public space. Talking to David korman right now, he said he'd be down to pay $100 per month to be able to use the space to work on projects. He is also super interesting in doing new member interviews, which I highly recommend him for. He also suggested vetting new members for their skills related to good listening and non violent communication.","Co-op structure,Membership Expectations",

"I personally would like to give workshops on printmaking, I think a lot of people are interested but just don't have access to the tools, because they're expensive. I would like to personally expand my printmaking ability: add in copperplate etching with electro-etching and aquatint to offer to people as a class as well (these are way hard to get access to if you're not a nerd).","Community Workshops,Art",

"Gaining new members: we should all agree/vote on new members not only a few people deciding, also weigh what they will bring to the community (both ours and the public offerings)... they after-all will be our family.",Co-op structure,
"I'd like to see building classes from some of our people who know how to do framing, construction etc (which there really isn't any classes of that I know of - I'd take them!).","Resiliency and Sustainability,Crafts & Skilled Trades",
"I like the idea of structured classes where people come, take a class and go, and less like the idea of being open to the public all the time where people are coming and going (especially during covid) and where things will go missing... but that's a personal preference, and I'm kinda an introvert sometimes. I think we should strike a balance between a community resource and a free-for-all of random people visiting all the time/just walking on in and borrowing things, where the makers are at the epicenter of a constant stream of people. I also think we should have a calendar of events that is very clear what is happening when and other times when the farm is not open to the public.","Community Resource,Membership Expectations",
